        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>
          All websites or services that humans constantly use to make their
          lives easier, collect user information and have privacy policies.
          However, these policies do not allow the user to control their data.
          What many do not know is that in the moment the user accepts the terms
          and conditions, they are providing their data to the company. This
          information may include personal data such as their IP address, name
          and surname, address, email, telephone number, and other information,
          very personal information. After providing this information, the user
          gives their consent for this data to be automatically collected, used,
          managed, and stored. Thus, the solution is to implement a new privacy
          policy for companies in which it prohibits collecting data
          automatically, in other words without that user actually being aware
          of what goes on behind the screen. Users should be able to make the
          decisions about their data, which is why companies must offer that
          option within their application or website. Along with this change,
          companies must increase the level of transparency of their data
          handling practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy policies already exist in most if not all companies, but they
          are not even close to being enough. This is the case because current
          privacy policies only allow the user to have some control over their
          data. For example, when companies use their users’ personal data for
          marketing purposes, the user can always present objections such as
          clicking the unsubscribe link, modifying their account settings, or
          simply just not accepting the company’s terms and conditions. However,
          users do not have a general control of their data because they do not
          know when, where or what data was collected. If more users had full
          understanding of all the information that is collected from them, they
          would not be comfortable with that data being shared. By applying our
          previously stated privacy policy to all companies, users will have
          general control of their data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If data is no longer collected automatically, personal data collection
          will only be available with consumers' prior consent. In this way, if
          US consumers want to share their data with companies, they will know
          when, where and what data was collected. Power would be returned to
          the user, with the first part of our policy which would force
          companies to make a small window where they would ask us if we want
          our information shared or not. This would not happen only at the
          beginning or at the end of our interaction with the website, service
          or application, but every time the company wants to collect our data.
          In other words, if the user is filling out a form, an option has to
          pop up on the screen, where the company shares how and for what the
          data is going to be used. After accepting their information to be
          shared, it is also important for users to know what companies the data
          is going to be shared with and what those companies are going to do
          once they have that data, which is the second part of the policy. In
          this way, the user can trust the company more, making them feel safe
          when using their platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the success of any company is having happy loyal customers and
          this can only be done by gaining the users’ trust, which goes hand in
          hand with how transparent a company is. In the article “Customer Data:
          Designing for Transparency and Trust” by Timothy Morey, Theodore
          “Theo” Forbath, and Allison Schoop, they mention that “..customers are
          most willing to share data when they know what value they’ll receive
          in return.” This customer relationship shows how important it is for
          companies to demonstrate transparency in the user data they gather.
          This is why the second part of the policy consists of building an
          easy-to-access section where the consumers who accepted their
          information to be shared, know what data has been collected already.
          In a detailed manner this section should display the data traffic,
          listing the time and date of the data collection, companies they
          shared the data with, and what those companies will be doing with the
          data. As user-friendly as possible, this section has to be located in
          a visible place of the website or application and it has to be simple
          and straightforward. In addition, they must provide an option where
          the consumers could delete their collected information and choose who
          their information could be shared with or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for our privacy policy to be implemented correctly, the terms
          and conditions also need to be reconsidered and presented in a new
          way. The terms and conditions we know today in any website or
          application are always too extensive, complicated, and too
          time-consuming. This has caused thousands, if not millions of users to
          simply click accept, without fully reading or comprehending because
          they just do not have the patience. Without scrolling through the
          entirety of it, means they are unaware of how their information is
          being collected and where it will end up. That is why we believe there
          should be a shorter and more precise version, similar to a summary,
          that would in turn ensure that most if not all people will read it and
          understand what they are reading. This shorter version will pop up as
          soon as the user opens the website or application, making it
          impossible to miss it. However, the original version of the terms and
          conditions would still appear in the same section where the second
          part of the policy is located. In this way, users would be able to
          refer back to the full version whenever they want, while companies
          would be able to avoid issues with the law if they were to only have a
          short version of their terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This solution could definitely improve the user’s experience with
          websites or applications, which translates to loyal, happy customers.
          Although the new policy is very concise and simple to understand, it
          requires a whole process to make it a working system. Regardless, it
          is a process that must take place because users deserve to be able to
          be aware of and control where their data is shared on the internet.
